Do you know what the Egyptian pyramids represent?
They are tombs built for the pharaohs—the dead. But have you ever heard of a pyramid that buries the living? One that we are trapped in right now?

That pyramid is Maslow’s Pyramid. It represents consumerism and the limits of our imagination. It has been deeply embedded in textbooks, posters, even advertising. And it has led us to believe that our needs must be arranged into a fixed pyramid—and that we must satisfy the lower levels before we can reach the top. It pushes us to focus only on satisfying ourselves: eating, shopping, playing—and in the process, we forget our dreams and our true goals.

Today, I want to show you the truth behind this pyramid and help you escape it.

Most people know Maslow’s original five-level pyramid. But in 1973, Abraham Maslow added three more levels, giving us the complete eight-level model.

Let’s explore these eight levels through one simple example: Why do you drink water?

When you drink water because you’re thirsty, that’s your Physiological need—basic survival.
If you drink water proactively to protect your health, that’s a Safety need.
When you remind or invite your friends or family to drink enough water, that’s Love and Belonging.
If you share a photo of yourself drinking water on social media, hoping for likes or compliments, that’s an Esteem need.
When you track your water intake, research the health benefits, and learn about proper hydration, you fulfill your Cognitive needs—knowledge and understanding.
If you apply that knowledge and choose the right kind of water, the right temperature, and what kind of water to drink, that’s Aesthetic.
If you make drinking enough water a 30-day challenge to build discipline and grow personally, that’s self-actualization.
And finally, if you start a charity to provide clean water to drought-affected communities, that’s Self-transcendence, the highest level: giving beyond yourself and leaving a legacy.

You can see it.
Just one simple action—drinking water—can fulfill all eight needs. The difference lies in your intention.

Maslow never drew a pyramid. But we’ve made two big mistakes:

We imagined these needs as a fixed pyramid.

We believed that we must completely fulfill one level before we’re allowed to move up to the next.

Why did this misunderstanding spread?
Because teachers and media love simple visuals. A pyramid is easy to explain.
Advertisers and marketers love the lower levels—food, fashion, insurance—because they help sell products. These basic needs also serve as the foundation to upsell premium services.
Companies use the pyramid to structure employee benefits, trapping people in fixed boxes of need.

All of this holds us back.
We get stuck in a cycle: earn money → spend → repeat.
We’re told that only after we have enough food, a nice house, and material comfort can we make friends, build self-esteem, or pursue dreams.

But have you ever imagined yourself as a motivational speaker, standing on stage before hundreds of people?
If you wait too long to “qualify” for the higher levels, you never reach knowledge, beauty, dreams, or understand the legacy you can leave behind.

When I found out that Maslow never drew a pyramid, I was shocked. And that changed everything.
Now, before I take action, I ask myself: “What need am I aiming for?”
I’ve stopped chasing just the lower four levels. I focus on the higher ones—where meaning and long-term value truly live.

Whatever you do, strive to be an excellent employee, a proud parent, or a dreamer. Think about your goals and the legacy you want to leave. Then act for that purpose.

The pyramids of Egypt were built for the dead. But today, you have the chance to escape the pyramid of the living.

So I ask you: Are you ready to truly live?
